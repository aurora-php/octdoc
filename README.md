octdoc - Source documentation extractor
=======================================

Preface
-------

Octdoc is a documentation convention and a tool for extracting documentation from programming source files.
Octdoc is not limited to a specific programming language but can be used to document source files of 
(almost) any programming language. Contrary to other documentation tools octdoc does not know anything about
programming languages used and is therefore unable to analyze source code. Because of this the octdoc convention
is a little bit more verbose than other documentation conventions like javadoc.

Examples
--------

The following are some documentation examples created with octdoc using the default "htmlui" output:

* http://doc.octris.org/org.octris.core/ (octris PHP framework)
* http://doc.octris.org/org.octris.ncurses/ (PHP OOP ncurses wrapper)
